            <p> Theory Explanation:</p>
        </h3>
        <p>Time and Work problems deal with the relationship between work done, time taken, and the efficiency of individuals or groups.</p>
        <h3><p>Basic Formulas:</p></h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>If a person can complete a work in n days, then their one-day work = 1/n.</li>
<li>If two people, A and B, complete a task in D days together, then their combined one-day work is 1/D.</li>
<li>If A is x times more efficient than B, then:
<ul>
<li>A’s work ratio to B’s = x:1</li>

<li>A will take 1/x of the time taken by B.</li></ul>

<li>If A can complete work in T1 days, and B can complete it in T2 days, then together they complete in:
<br><br><center>(T1*T2)/(T1+T2)</center>
</li>
<br>
<li>If A can do a job in T1 days and B can do it in T2 days, and C can do it in T3 days, then together they can complete it in:
<br><br><center>(T1*T2*T3)/(T1T2+T2T3+T3T1)</center>
 </li><br>
<li>Work and Wages:</li>
<ul>
<li>Wages are distributed based on the ratio of work done by individuals.</li>
</ul></p>
