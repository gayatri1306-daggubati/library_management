            <p>In this classic story, Mickey, along with his friends Donald Duck and Goofy, live in Happy Valley, which was once a prosperous land but has now fallen into despair. The reason? A magical golden harp that kept the valley fertile and joyful has been stolen by a giant named Willie.
                Struggling with hunger, Mickey trades their last cow for magic beans. At first, Donald and Goofy are furious, but overnight, the beans grow into a massive beanstalk that reaches up into the sky. The trio climbs the beanstalk and discovers a magnificent castle in the clouds—home to Willie the Giant, who has the stolen harp.
