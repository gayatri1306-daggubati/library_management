            <p>One of the most beloved stories from Malgudi Days, "Swami and Friends" follows the adventures of Swaminathan, a mischievous yet innocent schoolboy living in the fictional town of Malgudi. Swami enjoys playing with his friends Rajam and Mani, but his carefree life takes a turn when he gets into trouble at school.</p>
        <p>One day, Swami’s teacher punishes him unfairly, leading to a rebellious outburst. In anger, he runs away from school, wandering through Malgudi’s streets and dreaming of escaping his troubles. However, his adventure turns into fear when he realizes he has nowhere to go. He eventually returns home, only to face scolding from his strict father.</p>

            <p>This gripping story revolves around an astrologer who earns his living by predicting people's futures in Malgudi’s busy marketplace. He is skilled in reading people’s expressions and cleverly using general observations to convince them of his supernatural abilities.</p>
            <p>One evening, a mysterious man challenges the astrologer to prove his skills. The astrologer, after carefully observing the man, starts revealing his past. Shockingly, he describes an incident where the man was attacked and left for dead. The man is astonished—how could the astrologer know this?

            <p>The twist comes when it is revealed that the astrologer himself was the attacker. Years ago, believing he had killed the man, he had fled his village in fear. Now, seeing the man alive, he cleverly convinces him to leave Malgudi forever.
            </p>
            <p>With its suspenseful plot and dramatic revelation, "The Astrologer’s Day" is a masterpiece showcasing Narayan’s storytelling brilliance.
