        <h1><center>Santiago and the King of Salem</center></h1>
        
            <p>Santiago, a young shepherd from Spain, dreams of finding treasure near the Egyptian pyramids. While contemplating whether to pursue this dream, he meets Melchizedek, the King of Salem, an old and wise man who changes his perspective on life. The king tells Santiago about the concept of a Personal Legend—a person’s true purpose in life. He explains that the universe helps those who truly desire something and teaches him to recognize omens, or signs, that guide people toward their destiny.

                To test Santiago’s commitment, the king asks for one-tenth of his flock in exchange for wisdom. Santiago hesitates but eventually agrees. Melchizedek then shares an important lesson through a story: a boy is sent to a wise man to learn the secret of happiness. The wise man tells him to walk around his palace carrying a spoon filled with oil without spilling it. When the boy succeeds, the man asks what he observed, and the boy realizes he saw nothing. He tries again, focusing on the palace’s beauty, but this time spills the oil. The wise man then tells him that happiness lies in balancing seeing the world while not forgetting one's responsibilities.</p>

                <p>Before leaving, the king gives Santiago two magical stones, Urim and Thummim, to help him make decisions when in doubt. Inspired by this encounter, Santiago sells his sheep and embarks on his journey to Egypt.
                    This moment is crucial because it sets Santiago on the path to discovering his Personal Legend. The king’s wisdom about omens and perseverance is one of the most famous lessons in The Alchemist, inspiring readers to follow their dreams despite uncertainty.

        <h1><center>The Alchemist’s Lesson at the Desert Monastery</center></h1>

    <p>After many trials, Santiago meets the Alchemist, a mysterious figure who teaches him the deeper meaning of the Soul of the World—the spiritual force that connects everything. As they travel together, the Alchemist tells Santiago that true transformation happens when a person follows their Personal Legend without fear.

        Their journey leads them to a desert monastery, where the Alchemist performs a fascinating demonstration. He turns lead into gold, proving the existence of the Philosopher’s Stone, an ancient alchemical secret. He then divides the gold into four parts, keeping one for himself, giving one to Santiago, one to the monk, and leaving one for Santiago in case he ever needs it. However, he warns Santiago that gold itself is not the real treasure; the true wealth lies in self-discovery and understanding the universe.</p>

<p>The Alchemist then tells Santiago that he must continue his journey alone. Santiago is initially hesitant, but the Alchemist assures him that everything he needs is within himself. With renewed confidence, Santiago follows the signs and finally reaches the pyramids, where he discovers the true meaning of his journey.

    This episode is significant because it highlights the novel’s core message: spiritual transformation is more valuable than material wealth. The Alchemist’s wisdom teaches Santiago—and the readers—that real treasure is not gold but the journey of personal growth and self-realization. It is one of the most memorable parts of The Alchemist, symbolizing the fulfillment of one’s destiny through faith, perseverance, and inner strength.</p>
