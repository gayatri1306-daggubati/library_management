        <h1><center>The Monkey and the Crocodile</center></h1><hr>
<p>Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a big tree near a river. The tree bore sweet and juicy fruits, which the monkey ate daily. One day, while enjoying his fruits, he saw a crocodile resting near the riverbank. Feeling kind, the monkey plucked some fruits and threw them to the crocodile. The crocodile was delighted and thanked the monkey.

<p>Soon, they became good friends. Every day, the monkey gave the crocodile fruits, and they talked for hours. One day, the crocodile took some fruits home for his wife. However, instead of being grateful, his wife became jealous. She thought, If my husband eats such sweet fruits, the monkey’s heart must be even sweeter! She asked the crocodile to bring the monkey home so she could eat his heart.</p>

<p>The crocodile was troubled, but he obeyed his wife. The next day, he invited the monkey for dinner. The monkey, being kind-hearted, agreed and climbed onto the crocodile’s back to cross the river. As they reached the deeper waters, the crocodile revealed his true intention</p>
  <p>The monkey was shocked but quickly regained his composure. Thinking fast, he said, “Oh, my friend, why didn’t you tell me earlier? I keep my heart on the tree! If you take me back, I will get it for you.”</p>  
<p>The foolish crocodile believed him and swam back to the tree. As soon as they reached the shore, the monkey jumped onto the tree and laughed, “You betrayed me, but I outsmarted you! Now go away, and never return.”

    The crocodile felt ashamed and swam away, never to return</p>

    <h1><center>The Foolish Lion and the Clever Rabbit</center></h1>
    <hr><hr>
    
    <p>In a dense jungle, there lived a fierce lion who hunted and killed animals without mercy. The terrified animals decided to make a deal. They would send one animal daily as food so that the lion wouldn’t kill randomly. The lion agreed.
    </p>
    <p>Days passed, and it was the turn of a clever rabbit. Instead of rushing to the lion, the rabbit took its time, reaching the lion’s den much later than usual. The angry lion roared, “Why are you so late?”

    <p>The rabbit bowed and said, “Mighty king, I was coming early, but another lion stopped me, claiming to be the real ruler of the jungle!”

        The lion was furious. “Another lion? Where is he?”</p>
<p>The rabbit led the lion to a deep well filled with water. Peering inside, the lion saw his own reflection but thought it was another lion. Furious, he roared at his reflection, and the “other lion” roared back. Enraged, the lion jumped into the well to attack his rival, only to drown.

    The clever rabbit returned safely, and the jungle was finally free from the lion’s terror.
