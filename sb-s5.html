        <h1><center>Pelageya’s Transformation into a Revolutionary</center></h1>
        <hr>
        
            <p>Pelageya Nilovna, a simple and timid woman, has spent her life in submission—first to her abusive husband and later to the harsh realities of being a poor widow. She has never questioned the world around her, living in fear and obedience. However, everything begins to change after her husband’s death when she notices that her son, Pavel Vlasov, is engaging in political discussions and secretly gathering with fellow workers.
                At first, Pelageya is deeply afraid for Pavel. She knows that opposing the authorities is dangerous, and she urges him to stay away from trouble. However, Pavel does not listen; instead, he grows more involved in socialist revolutionary activities, distributing illegal pamphlets and organizing workers. Slowly, Pelageya starts to listen to his speeches, and for the first time, she begins to understand the oppression that the working class faces.
                One day, Pavel and his comrades decide to distribute revolutionary pamphlets that contain messages of hope and rebellion for the workers. Knowing how risky this task is, Pelageya volunteers to help. She hides the pamphlets in her basket, pretending to go to the market, and secretly delivers them</p>

<p>At first, she is terrified, her hands trembling as she walks past the police. However, with each delivery, her fear lessens, and she begins to feel a new sense of purpose.
    As the story progresses, Pelageya evolves from a fearful, submissive woman into a determined revolutionary. When Pavel is eventually arrested for his activism, instead of breaking down, she takes up his cause, continuing his work despite the risks. Her journey is one of the most powerful moments in Mother, showcasing the transformation of an ordinary woman into a symbol of resistance.
    Gorky uses Pelageya’s story to illustrate a larger theme—how even the weakest individuals can rise against oppression when they recognize injustice. Her transformation is not just personal; it represents the awakening of the working class, making this one of the most significant and inspiring parts of the novel.

    <hr>
    
        <p>One of the most dramatic and emotional moments in Mother occurs when Pavel Vlasov is arrested and put on trial for spreading revolutionary ideas. This scene is not just about his fate; it is a powerful representation of the struggle between the oppressed and the ruling class.
            After being caught distributing socialist pamphlets, Pavel is brought to court, where he faces serious charges. The courtroom is filled with workers and supporters, all eager to hear what he has to say. Instead of pleading for mercy or defending himself, Pavel stands tall and delivers a passionate speech about the suffering of the working class.
            He speaks about the exploitation of workers, the injustice of the Tsarist regime, and the need for revolution. He boldly declares that his struggle is not just for himself but for all workers who suffer under tyranny.</p>

<p>Despite his stirring speech, the court finds him guilty, and he is sentenced to exile in Siberia. However, rather than breaking his spirit, this only strengthens his resolve. He walks out of the courtroom with his head held high, knowing that his words have left an impact.
    Pelageya watches her son with immense pride. Though she is heartbroken that he will be taken away, she does not cry or beg. Instead, she realizes that the revolution must go on, even without Pavel. Determined to continue his mission, she steps forward as a leader among the workers, carrying forward the fight for justice.
    This scene is one of the most significant in Mother because it symbolizes the unstoppable power of the working-class movement. Pavel’s courage, even in the face of imprisonment, shows that oppression can never silence the voice of truth. His speech becomes a rallying cry for others to join the revolution, making this one of the most famous and impactful moments in the novel.
