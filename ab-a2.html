            <H3>Theory Explanation:</H3>
            <p>Syllogism is a type of logical reasoning that consists of statements (premises) leading to a conclusion.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Statements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Universal Affirmative (A type):</strong> All A are B.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Negative (E type):</strong> No A is B.</li>
                <li><strong>Particular Affirmative (I type):</strong> Some A are B.</li>
                <li><strong>Particular Negative (O type):</strong> Some A are not B.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Basic Rules of Syllogism:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Two universal affirmative statements lead to a universal affirmative conclusion.</li>
                <li>One universal affirmative + one universal negative leads to a universal negative conclusion.</li>
                <li>Two particular statements do not lead to a definite conclusion.</li>
                <li>If one statement is particular, the conclusion must be particular.</li>
                <li>Negative conclusions can only be drawn from at least one negative statement.</li>
            </ul>
